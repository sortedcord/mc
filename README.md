# SortedCraft

A custom modpack built for my own minecraft forge installation. This modpack includes many performance and QOL mods that may not even be allowed on most vanilla servers. Moreover, this includes mods that stray away completely. 

This is basically a personal repository for minecraft mods I generally use.
